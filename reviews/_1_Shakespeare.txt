The following quotes are from Act 2, scene 7, of William Shakespeare's play As You Like It.
Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy.
This wide and universal theatre presents more woeful pageants than the scene wherein we play in.
All the world's a stage and all the men and women merely players.
They have their exits and their entrances and one man in his time plays many parts, his act being 7 ages.
