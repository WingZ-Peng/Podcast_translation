I work with the team that does moonshots for a living. So I'm always looking for what can we shoot for. And our goal really is like, gosh, we're can't we apply this technology. I mean, just anywhere that it is at all difficult to get, you know, medical expertise. We can ease the burden of doctors by making it so they don't have to travel to provide these specialized care and increase the access to healthcare to these people that normally wouldn't be able to get access to us. So yeah, the scoop is.
As far as the mind can imagine it.
You're listening to Collaborators, a Microsoft Research podcast showcasing the range of expertise that goes into transforming mind-blowing ideas into world changing technologies. I'm Doctor Gretchen Huizenga.
On this episode, I'm talking to Doctor Spencer Fowers, A principal member of the technical staff at Microsoft Research, and Doctor Kwame Darko, a plastic surgeon at the National Reconstructive Plastic Surgery and Burn Center at the Korle BU Teaching Hospital in Accra, Ghana.
Spencer and Kwame are working on 3D telemedicine, a project they hope will increase access to specialized healthcare in rural and underserved communities by using live 3D communication or hollow portation. We'll learn much more about that in this episode. But first, let's meet our collaborators. Spencer, I'll start with you. Tell us about the technical staff in the Special Projects division of Microsoft Research. What kind of work do you do? What's the research model, and what's your particular role there? Hi, Gretchen.
Thanks for having me on here. Yeah. Yeah. So our group at Special Projects was kind of patterned after the Lockheed Martin Skunk Works methodology. You know we are very much a sort of try big moon shot projects type group. Our goal is sort of to focus on any sort of pie in the sky idea that has some sort of a business application. So you can imagine we've done things like build the world's first underwater data center or do post quantum cryptography things like that.
Anything that is a very ambitious project that we can try to iterate on and see what type of an application we can find for it in the real world. And I'm one of the, as you said, a principal and member of the technical staff. That means I'm one of the primary researchers. So I wear a lot of different hats. My job is everything from, you know, managing the project, meeting with people like Kwame and and the other surgeons that we've worked with and then interfacing there and finding ways that we can take.
Theoretical research and turned it into applied research actually find a way that we can bring that theory into reality. You know, that's a really interesting characterization because normally you think of those things in.
